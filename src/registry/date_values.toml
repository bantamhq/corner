# Date value definitions for autocomplete
# Used in entry @dates (recurring only) and filter date range values
#
# Fields:
# - syntax: Identifier for the entry (used for display grouping)
# - display: What appears in hint overlay
# - scopes: Where this date value is valid ["entry", "filter"]
#           entry = recurring patterns only (@every-*)
#           filter = relative dates for date range queries
# - values: (optional) Enumerated valid completions - input matches if prefix of any value
# - pattern: (optional) Regex for validation - input matches if it could complete to match
# - help: Short help text
# - readme: Text for README (empty = skip)
# - completion_hint: Description shown during autocomplete

# Filter-only: Literal Dates (simple prefix matching against syntax)
